In this directory you'll find:
- A minimal HTML file;
- An empty CSS file;
- A logo PNG;
- A header login icon for the phone sized version;
- A design & design-phone PNGs.

Please update the included style sheet so that it looks like the design & design-phone PNGs within a single style sheet file.

Note: In phone version “Login” changes to “header login icon”.

This is a CSS exercise, so you should make necessary changes ONLY to the CSS file.

You can use chrome to emulate a phone device:
