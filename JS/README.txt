In this directory you'll find a minimal HTML page, including a stylesheet and an empty JavaScript file. The page contains a group of input fields that a user might enter their address into, as well as a larger, empty text-area.

When the "Combine" button is clicked, please use JavaScript to join all of the individual address fields into a single string. Then insert that string into the text-area. Use the following format:

    123 Fake Way, Suite 404
    Boston, MA 012345

This is a JavaScript exercise, so you should only make necessary changes (if any) to the markup. You can use toolkits & frameworks for convenience, but you’re not required to do so.

For example you can include:

- AngularJS (prefered)
<script src=“https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.0-rc.0/angular.min.js”></script>

- jQuery
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>
